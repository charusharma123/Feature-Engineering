        "- A parameter in machine learning is a configuration variable that is internal to the model and whose value can be estimated from data. Parameters are crucial for model performance as they define how input data is transformed into the desired output. For example, in a linear regression model, the slope and intercept of the line are parameters that the algorithm learns from the training data.\n",
